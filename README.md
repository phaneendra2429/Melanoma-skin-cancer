## Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection

**Introduction:**
This project aims to develop a deep learning system for detecting Melanoma skin cancer using neural networks. The repository includes code files for data preparation, model development, and evaluation to create an automated tool for early detection of skin cancer.

**Files Included:**
1. **Phaneendra_G_nn.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for implementing the neural network for skin cancer detection.
2. **Data Sanity Check for Deep Learning Systems via Learnt Assertions.html**: This file likely contains the results of the data sanity check process.
3. **README.md**: Documentation file that provides information about the project and how to use the code files.

**Project Structure:**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The project starts with a data sanity check process to ensure dataset quality.
   - Data preprocessing techniques are used to prepare skin images for training the neural network.
   - Data augmentation is performed to increase the dataset size and variability.

2. **Model Development:**
   - A neural network architecture is designed and implemented using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - The model is trained on the prepared dataset for classifying skin images as benign or malignant.
   - Hyperparameters are optimized, and techniques like oversampling are applied to handle imbalanced data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Cross-validation and regularization techniques are used to ensure model robustness and generalization.

**Contributions and Outcomes:**
- The project aims to contribute to the healthcare field by providing a reliable and efficient tool for early detection of Melanoma skin cancer.
- The developed deep learning system aims to accurately classify skin images and assist in the detection of skin cancer.
- The project emphasizes creating a solution that can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma.

**Note:** The code files in this repository can be used for implementing the neural network model for Melanoma skin cancer detection. For further details on how to use the code files and replicate the results, refer to the Jupyter notebook and the README.md file included in the repository.
